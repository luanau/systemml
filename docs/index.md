SystemML is now an **Apache Incubator** project! Please see the [**Apache SystemML (incubating)**](http://systemml.apache.org/)
website for more information.

SystemML is a flexible, scalable machine learning system.
SystemML's distinguishing characteristics are:

  1. **Algorithm customizability via R-like and Python-like languages**.
  2. **Multiple execution modes**, including Standalone, Spark Batch, Spark MLContext, Hadoop Batch, and JMLC.
  3. **Automatic optimization** based on data and cluster characteristics to ensure both efficiency and scalability.

The [**SystemML GitHub README**](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml) describes
building, testing, and running SystemML. Please read [**Contributing to SystemML**](contributing-to-systemml.html)
to find out how to help make SystemML even better!

To download SystemML, visit the [downloads](http://systemml.apache.org/download.html) page.


## Running SystemML

* **Standalone** - Standalone mode allows data scientists to rapidly prototype algorithms on a single
machine in R-like and Python-like declarative languages.
  * The [SystemML GitHub README](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml) describes
  a linear regression example in Standalone Mode.
  * The [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.html) provides additional examples of algorithm execution
  in Standalone Mode.
* **Spark Batch** - Algorithms are automatically optimized to run across Spark clusters.
  * See **Invoking SystemML in Spark Batch Mode** **(Coming soon)**.
* **Spark MLContext** - Spark MLContext is a programmatic API for running SystemML from Spark via Scala or Java.
  * See the [Spark MLContext Programming Guide](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide.html) for
  [**Spark Shell (Scala)**](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide.html#spark-shell-example),
  [Java](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide.html#java-example), and
  [**Zeppelin Notebook**](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide.html#zeppelin-notebook-example---linear-regression-algorithm)
  examples.
* **Hadoop Batch** - Algorithms are automatically optimized when distributed across Hadoop clusters.
  * See [Invoking SystemML in Hadoop Batch Mode](hadoop-batch-mode.html) for detailed information.
* **JMLC** - Java Machine Learning Connector.
  * See [Java Machine Learning Connector (JMLC)](jmlc.html) for more information.

## Language Guides

* [DML Language Reference](dml-language-reference.html) -
DML is a high-level R-like declarative language for machine learning.
* **PyDML Language Reference** **(Coming Soon)** -
PyDML is a high-level Python-like declarative language for machine learning.
* [Beginner's Guide to DML and PyDML](beginners-guide-to-dml-and-pydml.html) -
An introduction to the basics of DML and PyDML.

## ML Algorithms

* [Algorithms Reference](algorithms-reference.html) - The Algorithms Reference describes the
machine learning algorithms included with SystemML in detail.

## Tools

* [Debugger Guide](debugger-guide.html) - SystemML supports DML script-level debugging through a
command-line interface.
