    Apache SystemML is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.
    While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
    or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
    fully endorsed by the ASF.
    
    Apache SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at 
    flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid runtime 
    plans ranging from single-node, in-memory computations, to distributed computations on Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
